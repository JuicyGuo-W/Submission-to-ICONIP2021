Abstract. Photographs play an important role in preserving memory and knowledge in a historical way. However, countless historical photographs dating back decades have been orphaned, with no anonymous faces and no living people able to identify the people in the photos[1]. This paper is about identification for matching to sparse natural person photos using three kinds of models including simple feed-forward neural network [4], bidirectional neural network [1] and convolutional neural network [3]. It is aiming to identify whether the two images are of the same person given pro-portions for distances of facial feature marker pairs [2]. This paper compares the best performances in 20 times for each model with identical settings since the way partitioning the unbalanced sparse dataset may cause unsta-ble results. All three shown superior performance comparing with dataset paper [2], with the order of superior: Feed-forward NN<BDNN<CNN mod-els. We have also greatly improve the accuracy from 75% in the dataset pa-per to at least 80% and at most 96%, which suggests superior capability of identification of sparse natural person photos.
